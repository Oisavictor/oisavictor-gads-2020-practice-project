                   Friday, August 28 - Friday, September 11 2020


# Description:
    Exploring the possibilities and opportunities to work with the gcloud SDK in more details


# Challenge(s):
    This is divided into two parts:
        1. Complete 10-15 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs,
            and submit proof of such per screenshot based on the email received.

        2.  Translate 2 - 3 selected Labs from the "console instruction" to 100%
            command line instructions.


# Submission:
    -   The results of both challenges listed above should be documented in a Github repository.

    -   Submit the documented github repo to the GADS Team @ bit.ly/GADSPracticeProjectSubmission


# Results:

1.  The Screenshots for the various lab have been attached to a Folder named "Qwiklabs Screenshot 15+ extras". 
Kindly refer to the list of labs that was carried out in this project, in the "ASSOCIATE CLOUD ENGINEER: PHASE 2 LAB LIST.md" 
file which is an extract from the instruction documentation.

2.  The Translations of the three (3) selected labs are named by their labs title and added into the folder title "Translations".


# Note that, the translated files are step by step guide as directed by the qwiklabs instruction and would not run as an automated script. 
However, for you to run an automated script, you would need to code one for yourself by copy all the individual codes for each Lab into their respective scripted files.
Then you can run them from the files which you have created with the .sh extension.
